		<h2>The Problem</h2>
			The <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> key serves mainly as a source of annoyance, and
			no one really uses it. However, the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key is quite useful
			(I'm primarily a Vim user), but is far too hard to reach.  Currently,
			&Eacute;owyn has altered key settings to make life a bit eaiser. The
			<kbd> Caps Lock</kbd> key now acts like the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.
		<h2>Stuff that didn't work</h2>
			I first tried this using the command
			<code>xmodmap -e `clear Lock' -e `keycode 0x42 = Escape'</code>
			but for some reason, it stopped working for one of my <span
	  class="roman">T</span><sub><span class="roman">E</span></sub><span
									class="roman">X</span>&nbsp; files.

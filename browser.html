		I get to sound like one of those Youtubers that test out new products! Fun times. Let's get started.
		<h3>The Situation</h3>
		Firefox wasn’t cutting it, so I started looking into other browsers. Plus, I was kinda bored one evening and did not want to start my homework.
		<h3>GNOME Web/Epiphany</h3>
		I started out by looking into GNOME Web (aka Epiphany), which is supposed to be
		lightweight and amazing. TL;DR: it wasn’t.
		<br><br>
		First off, install Epiphany by typing in the following commands:
		<pre><div class="realcode">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install epiphany-browser
</div></pre>
		<h4>Pros</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>It’s faster than Firefox</li>
			<li>It deals with passwords cleaner in non-private browsing mode</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Cons</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>It makes &Eacute;owyn make a high-pitched sound and leads to overheating. I tried recali-
				brating powertop after installation, but that didn’t help any.</li>
			<li>It doesn’t have a “never remember history” option</li>
			<li>Private browsing settings are kinda weird</li>
			<li>Difficult and nonintuitive to customize</li>
		</ul>
		Overall, I wasn’t really a big fan (no pun intended, but the fans were running a bit too
		much). The main reason why I didn’t go with Epiphany was probably the weird hissing
		sounds my laptop started making. I cleaned up afterwards by getting rid of the repo and
		by uninstalling Epiphany.


		<h3>Chromium</h3>
		I installed and used Chromium for the better part of 10 minutes. This (obviously) had
		the same look and feel as Chrome, but I still wasn’t a big fan of its RAM consumption and
		lack of a PDF viewer (which I figured was super standard, but I guess not). I uninstalled
		Chromium and moved on with life.
		<h3>Opera</h3>
		I installed Opera using the Ubuntu Software app, and not through command line.
		<h4>Pros</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>It has a battery conserving mode! You can choose whether you want to enable it all
				the time, or only when you’re not connected to external power</li>
			<li>Super easy to customize, with multiple themes! The task bar is easier to customize
				than any other browser I’ve used. There are so many options</li>
			<li>The GUI is intuitive, more so than MS Edge, Firefox, or Chrome.</li>
			<li>It seems faster than Firefox</li>
			<li>Videos work (HTML5), unlike in GNOME Web/Epiphany.</li>
			<li>VPNS! I love them</li>
			<li>The pop-out video feature is super cool and useful</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Cons</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>There’s not really a “never remember history” option, like there was in Firefox</li>
			<li>Situation regarding addons is confusing</li>
			<li>FB Messenger is kinda weird; it only works sometimes</li>
		</ul>
		It also gives you an option to <a href="https://help.opera.com/en/latest/security-and-privacy/#VPN">enable VPN</a>:
		<ol>
			<li>Go to <span class="a">Settings</span> <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> <span class="a">Advanced</span> and double click <span class="a">Advanced</span></li>
			<li>Go to <span class="a">VPN</span> and turn on <b>Enable VPN</b></li>
			<li>Go to the top of the search bar; you’ll see the letters “VPN” in a light grey. Click on
				that, so that it becomes blue. This will let you pick the location.</li>
		</ol>
		Also, keep in mind that by default, addons/extentions are not enabled in private mode; you have to go and add them manually.
		<br><br>
		Overall, I’m pretty happy with this one. We’ll see how it goes!

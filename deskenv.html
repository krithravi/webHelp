		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		So ... I was procrastinating on a few assignments and was looking into
		different desktop environments. After a bit of Googling, I landed on
		Xfce (comes as default with Xubuntu, which I don’t have installed). I
		honestly don’t remember how I installed it; it had something to do
		with xargs or xorgs or something to that effect.
		<br> <br>
		Long story
		short, it was a disaster. I half-heartedly tried to customize it, but
		it’s really not worth it (at least with my config). From my experience,
		GNOME is far more user-friendly. Perhaps Xfce would have been nicer had
		I spend more time with it, but for the few hours I spent with it, It was
		the worst<sup>TM</sup>.
		<br><br>
		Here’s some important advice: <b>don’t install something unless you know
			how to uninstall it</b>. Seriously. The uninstallation process for
		Xfce was not clean.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="box">
		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		I tried uninstalling some packages and things
		based off some answers I got from Stack- Overflow/StackExchange. I’m honestly
		not sure what the difference is between Xubuntu and normal Ubuntu, but whenever
		I rebooted my computer, it started out with the Xubuntu screen (maybe this was
		harmless, or maybe not, but either way it was bugging me).
		<br><br>
		<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/92084/how-to-remove-xubuntu-desktop">
			Other StackOverflow answer </a> to the rescue! I used a couple of
		commands:
		<ol>
			<li>
				<div class="realcode">
					sudo apt-get autoremove --purge xubuntu-* && sudo apt-get autoremove --purge
					xfce* </div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="realcode">sudo apt-get autoremove --purge $( dpkg-query -l *xubuntu* | grep ii | tr -s " " | cut -d" " -f2; dpkg-query -l *xfce* | grep 'ii' | tr -s " " | cut -d" " -f2 )
				</div>
			</li>
		</ol>
		I'm not sure if both commands are necessary, but I ran both, rebooted,
		and the Xubuntu screen did not appear!
		<br> <br>
		I'm probably going to wind up configuring a desktop environment for
		Pippin at some point in time. Right now, I'm considering i3, but I'm not
		sure. If/when I do set it up, I'll update it here.

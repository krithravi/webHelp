		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		&Eacute;owyn, my lovely Dell XPS 15 9570, likes to give its Ubuntu (and Linux) users hell when
		it comes to going to sleep mode and waking up.
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="box">
		<h3>Stuff that didn't work</h3>
		The first solution I looked up was command-line ways to put the computer to sleep. I
		tried using the <div class="realcode">pm-suspend-hybrid</div> command from <span class="a">pm-utils</span> as a superuser (which did
		nothing) as well as tried the <div class="realcode">systemcl hibernate</div> command. The latter had the same
		effect as closing the laptop, unfortunately.
		<br><br>
		The next step was checking out my BIOS settings.
		<ol>
			<li>Get drivers (an <span class="a">.exe</span> file) from the Dell website (a truly dreadful experience), put the
				file on a USB drive, and mount the drive.</li>
			<li>Shut down the computer and enter the BIOS by pressing the F2 key, and going
				to <span class="a">Settings</span> <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> <span class="a">Power Management</span> <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> <span class="a">USB Wake Support</span> as well as <span class="a">Settings</span> <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> <span class="a">Power
					Management</span> <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> <span class="a">Block Sleep</span>.</li>
			<li>One website said that the <code class="inline">Enable USB Wake Support </code> button would be disabled, and that
				I should enable it. It also said that that the <code class="inline">Block Sleep</code> option would also be selected,
				and that I should disable it. However, my BIOS settings were already in these states.</li>
			<li>The next step was to update the BIOS.
				<ol>
					<li>Repeatedly pressing <code class="inline">F12</code> (I don’t actually know if doing it only once suffices)</li>
					<li>Selecting the <code class="inline">BIOS Flash Update</code></li>
					<li>Navigating to and selecting that <span class="a">.exe</span> file we talked about earlier</li>
					<li>Waiting for a <i>while</i></li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		This did absolutely zilch to fix the issue, but it was a learning experience. Yay! I now
		know how to update my BIOS.

		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		There’s a pretty simple <a href="https://youtu.be/f-u7Zk_itUU">4-ish minute long YouTube video</a> that explained this the best. The
		chap pulled a ton of this stuff from ArchWiki. The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_15_7590">pertinent stuff</a> can be found in the
		<b>Power Management</b> section of the page.
		<ol>
			<li>If you type <div class="realcode">cat /sys/power/mem_sleep</div> you’ll see the (default) response:
				<span class="a">[s2idle] deep</span>, meaning that the s2idle is selected.</li>
			<li>To fix the issue, you’ll want to use the deep version instead. You could just go ahead
				and use the command <div class="realcode">echo deep|sudo tee/sys/power/mem_sleep</div> which would
				temporarily fix the issue.</li>
			<li>To make the change permanent, change the kernel parameters by editing the <span class="b">/etc/default/grub</span> as a superuser.</li>
			<li> In the <span class="b">grub</span> file, the <span class="b">GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</span> (the boot options) is set to
				<span class="b">quiet splash</span>.
				<ul>
					<li> The <span class="b">quiet</span> part just means “non-verbose.” Without this, a bazillion messages
						would be printed to the screen. </li>
					<li>The <span class="b">splash</span> bit gives us something to look at while the real stuff loads in the
						background. Without this, we’d just be staring at a blank screen.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>After the <span class="b">quiet splash</span>, add the text <span class="b">mem_sleep_default=deep</span>.</li>
			<li>Now type <div class="realcode">sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</div>
			</li>
			<li>Reboot, test, and we’re done!</li>
		</ol>

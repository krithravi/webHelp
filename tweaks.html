		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		I needed to be able to type diacritics with my keyboard on &Eacute;owyn.
		I installed the "English (intl., with AltGr dead keys)" keyboard, but
		when I typed in the correct key bindings, such as <code
	  	class="inline">AltGr</code>+<code class="inline">a</code>, the character
		"&aacute;" was not produced. 

		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		The issue was that the <code class="inline">Compose</code> key was not set. Hence,
		I had to set the <code class="inline">Compose</code> key to the 
		<code class="inline">AltGr</code> key.
		<br><br>
		I did this by installing the <span class="a">gnome-tweaks</span> utility with 
		<span class="b">sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool</span> and ran it with 
		<span class="b">gnome-tweaks</span>. In Tweaks, 
		I went to <span class="a">Keyboard & Mouse</span> <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 
		<span class="a">Compose Key</span>. The default is set to <span class="b">off</span>,
		but you can toggle that switch and pick the key you want. I went with 
		<code class="inline">AltGr</code>, since that was wwhat the keyboard I downloaded said to use.
		<h3>Additional Fun Stuff</h3>
		You can do a lot of other cool things with Tweaks - you can customize how pretty much 
		everything looks. You can change the fonts the OS uses, what format the time
		should be printed in, pick which apps should be launched at boot up, and so much more.

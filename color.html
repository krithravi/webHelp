		<h3>The Situation</h3>
			I didn’t really like the <a
	  href="https://design.ubuntu.com/brand/colour-palette/"> default shades of
   purple that Ubuntu uses
   for boot-up</a>, so I wanted to change them to a pretty shade of
			green.
		<h3>Stuff that didn't work</h3>
	I tried changing the other instances of the aubergine purple by changing one
	of the instances of <span class="b">#2c001e</span>, but to my knowledge, that did nothing.

		<h3>The Solution</h3>
		To change the color of the login screen:
		<ol>
			<li>Type <div class="realcode">xhost +local: && sudo vim
					/etc/alternatives/gdm3.css</div> You can change the editor
				to Emacs or whatever you like. </li>
			<li>Go to the block that begins with <span
				 class="b">#lockdialogGroup</span> , and change the hex color from
			 <span class="b">#2c001e</span> to whatever you want. I’m using
			 <span class="b">#0a3621</span>. </li>
		</ol>
		You know how there's a screen that appears before your lock screen? That
		screen was still purple, so I wanted to make that green as well.

		<ol>
			<li>Type <div class="realcode"> sudo vim
					/usr/share/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-logo/ubuntu-logo.script</div> </li>
			<li>Go to the lines beginning with <span
				 class="b">Window.SetBackground</span>. There’ll be two of them.
			 <li>The default color on these lines is <span class="b">(0.16, 0.00,
					 0.12)</span>, which corresponds to
				 <span class="b">#2c001e</span>. Change this (on both lines) to whatever you want (these are ratios). I’m
				 using <span class="b">(0.04, 0.21, 0.13)</span>. </li>
			 <li>Type <div class="realcode">sudo update-initramfs -u</div> </li>
			 <li>That should be it! Check out <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/20829/how-can-i-change-the-purple-background-color-of-ubuntu-plymouth-boot-screen" >this link</a> for more info. </li>
		</ol>
		When I boot up, there's a quick flash of purple that still appears, but
		I haven't yet figured out why that is.

		<h1>Network Connection for Arch Linux ARM</h1>

		<h3>The Problem</h3>This is pretty fundamental: I just wanted to get
		access to WiFi, so that I could install the rest of my packages and
		continue setting up Pippin. I needed this to work before I could do much
		else - I was working without an Ethernet cable for most part. I ran
		everything as root for the following steps, so I have no clue which
		commands require superuser privileges.
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="box">
		<h3>Stuff I tried that didn't work</h3>
		Holy heavens. This was my first
		time tinkering with Arch, and people did warn me that it'd be rough. I
		just hadn't imagined that it'd take me the better part of half a day to get
		the WiFi to work. I tried a bunch of different things ... none of which
		worked.
		<h4>Wifi Menu</h4>
		The first thing I tried was running the <span class="a">wifi-menu</span> as root. It prompted me to pick the WiFi
		network and enter in the password. I tried a few different networks, all
		with correct passwords, but I kept getting an error message.
		<br><br>
		I also ran into other issues while trying to figure this out. Turns out,
		sometimes it'll save a network profile for you, which will make it so
		that that same network will not appear in the <span class="a">wifi-menu</span>. These profiles will appear in the <span class="b">/etc/netctl</span> directory, which you'll have to delete
		if you want the corresponding networks to show up in the menu. This led
		me to the next thing I tried.
		<h4>Netctl</h4>
		I spent a ridiculous number of hours in the <span class="b">/etc/netctl</span> directory; I'm sick of it. By the way,
		everything in these steps was done as root, since (a) I didn't feel like
		typing <span class="b">sudo</span> every time, and (b), I couldn't even
		install it without network connection.
		<br><br>
		I ran the command <div class="realcode">lspci -k </div> to check if the
		kernel loaded the driver. I got no result. As I mentioned early, the
		<span class="a">wifi-menu</span> and the <span class="a">netctl</span> methods talk to each other,
		in terms of creating profiles. Since I'd already established that
		the <span class="a">wifi-menu</span> method wasn't working to create
		a valid profile, I tried to make my own.
		<ol>
			<li> To figure out the name of my interface, so I ran the
				command <div class="realcode">iwconfig</div> I saw three labels
				on the LHS, <span class="b">lo</span>, <span class="b">wlan0</span>, and <span class="b">eth0</span>. Hence,
				my interface was called <span class="b">wlan0</span>.</li>
			<li>I went to the <span class="b">examples</span> and took a look. I
				made a copy of the <span class="b">wireless-wpa</span> profile in
				the <span class="b">netctl</span> directory. </li>
			<li> I edited my copy of the profile and filled in the necessary
				components:
				<ul>
					<li>Interface (in my case) is <span class="b">wlan0</span> </li>
					<li>ESSID is name of WiFi network</li>
					<li>key is the WiFi password</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Run the command <div class="realcode">netctl start
					my_profile</div>
			</li>
			<li>At this point, you should test your connection. Consider
				<span class="a">ping</span>ing a website you like. </li>
			<li>If it works, great! You can set it to be long-term using the
				command <div class="realcode">netctl enable
					my_profile</div> Since I didn't even get it to work
				(the previous two steps), I didn't bother running this.</li>

		</ol>
		I tested this several times with different spellings of the WiFi
		networks (I don't think it would have made a difference
		either way, but it was worth a shot). I also repeated this
		process with the other <span class="b">wpa</span>-related
		example profile to no avail.

		<h4>WPA Supplicant </h4>
		I spend an inordinate amount of time watching videos on people
		setting up their machines with Arch, and some of them set up their
		WiFi by setting up their <span class="b">/etc/wpa_supplicant</span>
		directories. To be honest, I couldn't really follow them easily, but
		here's what I did based on the <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WPA_supplicant">ArchLinux page</a>. I ran the following commands in the <span class="b">/etc/wpa_supplicant</span> directory:

			<pre><div class="realcode">touch wpa_supplicant.conf
echo "ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant" >> wpa_supplicant.conf
echo "update_config=1" >> wpa_supplicant.conf
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c wpa_supplicant.conf
wpa_cli</div></pre>
			After starting the program, I ran the commands
			<pre><div class="realcode">scan
scan_results
</div></pre>
			On the these commands, however, I got error messages. I didn't proceed with the
			rest of the instructions, since I couldn't even see the available networks,
			which was necessary to set the SSID and password of the network. However, I was
			a dumb frog, and didn't realize that I just needed to read further on the page.
			<br><br>
			I don't know why none of these worked.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>The Solution</h3>The solution is underwhelmingly simple, and
			involves the WPA supplicant method:
			<br><br>
			I had to run:
<pre><div class="realcode">cat << EOF >> root/etc/systemd/network/wlan0.network
[Match]
Name=wlan0

[Network]
DHCP=yes
EOF

wpa_passphrase "${SSID}" "${PASS}" > root/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf

ln -s \
   /usr/lib/systemd/system/wpa_supplicant@.service \
   root/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/wpa_supplicant@wlan0.service <div></pre>


	replacing <span class="b">$"{SSID}"</span> with the name of the network, and the
<span class="b">$"{PASS}"</span> with the password.
<br><br>
This finally worked :)

<br><br>
I'm adding this at another date. Another solution that's substantially easier
is to hook yourself up to an Ethernet connection, and install the <span class="a">network manager</span>, which comes with both <span class="a">nmcli</span> and <span class="a">nmtui</span> programs, which are
pretty intuitive to use.
<br><br>
While I had initially tried to install this program, I hadn't realized that
being on a university campus (with the weird login page) may have been affecting
my ability to login. Again, I'm not sure, but when I took Pippin back home and
retried some things, I was magically able to install this. I figured this out by
reflashing Pippin with Debian, but running into the same issues (not being able
to install/update anything).
<br><br>
Moral of the story? Do this at home.

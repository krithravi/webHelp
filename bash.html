		<h3>Customizing the Command Prompt</h3>
		There’s an insane number of things you can do to improve your Bash experience, one
of which being changing up your command prompt.
<br><br>
There are couple of definitions to note within this section: the environmental variables
<span class="b">$PS1</span> and <span class="b">$PS2</span>. <span class="b">$PS1</span> refers to the primary command prompt, the one you see every time
you open up a Bash terminal. <span class="b">$PS2</span> refers to the secondary command prompt, which is what
you see when the terminal is expecting more input from you, like when you use
<span class="a">gcalccmd</span>.
<br><br>
		<h4>The Problem</h4>
		I found the default primary command prompt to be a bit too long; it was
		eating up valuable screen space. Hence, I set it to something shorter,
		my initials in bold green, and a dollar sign: <span class="b">\e[1;32mKR$ \e[m</span>.
		<br><br>
		However, when I use the <code class="inline">Ctrl</code>+<code
								class="inline">p</code> or the <code
		class="inline">Up Arrow</code> key to access the previous command,
	sometimes, it'll held a part of the previous line in the command line. This
	did not affect the next command I ran, but it still bugged me.
		<h4>Stuff that didn't work</h4>
		Based on StackOverflow's answers, I enclosed my prompt in <span
  class="b">\[</span> and <span class="b">\]</span>, to get <span
								class="b">\[\e[1;32mKR$ \e[m\]</span>, but that
							was even worse.
		<h4>The Solution</h4>
		Turns out, I didn't read the answers correctly. The solution is to
		change the command prompt, the value of <span class="b">$PS1</span> by enclosing things that
		begin with <span class="b">\e</span> in <span class="b">\[</span> and
		<span class="b">\]</span>.  These are the nonprintable portions.


	I had to split this up into two different sections, one for each
	nonprintable chunk. Hence, I was left with <span
		class="b">\[\e[1;32m\]</span> and <span class="b">\[\e[m\]</span> once I
	had added in those sequences.

		The final solution was <span class="b">\[\e[1;32m\]KR$
			\[\e[m\]</span>.
		<h3>Changing Appearance of Bash Layout</h3>
You can change the colors of how your directories, files and other things look when you
list out the contents of a directory. This stuff is stored in an environmental variable called
<span class="b">$LS_COLORS</span>.
<br><br>
If you type <div class="realcode">echo $LS_COLORS</div> you’ll see a bunch of gunk. If you want to play around
before committing to anything, you can set another environmental variable to the value
of <span class="b">$LS_COLORS</span>, and make any changes you want to <span class="b">$LS_COLORS</span> to check it out. These
changes will go away once you kill the current terminal. If you want any changes to be
permanent, just add a line to your <span class="b">.bashrc</span> file.
<br><br>
There are a gazillion options to customizing your setup, but a basic one could read as
follows: <div class="realcode">di=1;36:*.png=1;35:ex=1;33</div>
Let’s go through it bit by bit:
<ol>
	<li>Directories are bright cyan</li>
	<li>All PNG images are purple</li>
	<li>All executables are bright yellow</li>
	<li>Entries are colon-separated</li>
</ol>
My current settings for this variable are in my <span class="b">.bashrc</span> file.
	</div>
